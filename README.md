## Task 
Task (One-Page Application): Build a one-page application using Node + React / Next.js / NestJS (any one).
Requirements:
1. Enter a list of items one at a time using a text box.
2. Display the items below the text box on the same page.
3. The list should have a title.
4. Items should be displayed as numbered or dotted list.
5. Add a README.md explaining how he planned and executed the task.
6. Bonus: Host the application and add the live link in the GitHub README.

*****************Design, colours, and UI and design are your creativity Application which should be mobile and web responsive.********


## <a id="how-it-works"></a>⚙️ How It Works (The "Restaurant" Analogy)
To understand how this app is built, think of a **Restaurant**:

1.  **The Customer (You)**: You visit the website.
2.  **The Waiter (Frontend)**: This is what you see and interact with (the buttons, the list). It takes your order (new item) and sends it to the kitchen.
    - *Tech used:* **React** (makes it interactive) & **CSS** (makes it look pretty).
3.  **The Kitchen (Backend)**: The kitchen receives the order and prepares it. It decides what to do with your request.
    - *Tech used:* **Node.js & Express** (the chefs processing orders).
4.  **The Pantry (Database)**: This is where the ingredients (your data) are stored safely on shelves. The kitchen grabs items from here or puts new ones in.
    - *Tech used:* **MongoDB** (a digital filing cabinet).

So when you click "Add Item":
**You** (Customer) &rarr; **Frontend** (Waiter) &rarr; **Backend** (Kitchen) &rarr; **Database** (Pantry).

## <a id="architecture"></a>🏗️ Technical Architecture (The Rules)
For the developers and Non-tech users, here is how we structured the code to keep it clean and organized. We prioritized separation of concerns and clear data flow.

### 1. Frontend (The "Face" of the App)
The frontend handles what the user sees and interacts with.

- **Vite**: A build tool that is significantly faster than standard tools like CRA. It provides instant server start and lightning-fast updates.
- **Vanilla CSS**: We didn't use pre-made kits (like Bootstrap). We wrote the styles from scratch to give it a unique, premium "Glass" look.

```css
/* Example of our Glass/Frosted Effect */
.glass-panel {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* This makes it blurry behind */
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px 0 rgba(31, 38, 135, 0.15);
}
```

- **Folder Structure**:
```text
Frontend/src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI parts (e.g., ItemList.jsx, Footer.jsx)
├── App.jsx         # The main container that holds everything
└── main.jsx        # The entry point that mounts React to the DOM
```

### 2. Backend (The "Brain" of the App)
The backend manages data persistence and business logic.

- **Express.js**: The traffic controller that handles all incoming requests.
- **Mongoose**: A translator that helps our Javascript code talk to the MongoDB database easily using strict definitions.

**Key Components:**

*   **Models (`models/`)**: Defines what an "Item" looks like.
    ```javascript
    // Example: models/Item.js
    const ItemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      text: { type: String, required: true }, // Must have text
      isBought: { type: Boolean, default: false } // Defaults to not bought
    });
    ```

*   **Controllers (`controllers/`)**: The logic. It says "If they want to save an item, do X, Y, Z".
    ```javascript
    // Example: controllers/itemController.js
    exports.createItem = async (req, res) => {
      const newItem = await Item.create(req.body); // Save to DB
      res.status(201).json(newItem); // Send back the new item
    };
    ```

*   **Routes (`routes/`)**: The address book. It tells the server where to send specific requests.
    ```javascript
    // Example: routes/itemRoutes.js
    router.post('/', itemController.createItem); // POST request -> Run createItem logic
    ```

- **Folder Structure**:
```text
Server/
├── models/         # Database Schemas (Blueprints for data)
├── controllers/    # Business Logic functions
├── routes/         # API Route definitions
└── index.js       # App Entry point (starts the server)
```

## <a id="deployment"></a>🚀 Deployment (Putting it Online)

### Frontend on Vercel
We put the website files on **Vercel**. It's like a super-fast content delivery service that makes sure the website loads quickly for everyone around the world.

### Backend on Render
We put the server logic on **Render**. It keeps the "Kitchen" open 24/7 so it can always answer requests from the website.

## <a id="setup"></a>💻 How to Run This on Your Computer

If you want to play with the code, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
You need to install **Node.js** (allows you to run code outside the browser).

### 1. Start the Server (The Kitchen)
Open your terminal (command prompt), go to the `Server` folder, and type:
```bash
cd Server
npm install   # Installs the tools needed
node index.js # Opens the kitchen
```
*The terminal will say: "Server is running..."*

### 2. Start the Website (The Waiter)
Open a NEW terminal, go to the `Frontend` folder, and type:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install  # Installs the tools needed
npm run dev  # Wakes up the waiter
```
*It will give you a link (like http://localhost:5173). Click it to see your app!*

## AI Use (**Antigravity**)
```
Act as a technical documentation writer.

Folders - Frontend and Server

Create a clear, well-structured README.md for a full-stack web application.
The audience includes beginners and evaluators.

Use the following sections and order:

1. Title & Links  
- Project title  
- Navigation line: Live Demo • About • How It Works • Architecture • Deployment • Setup  
- Live Demo section with:
  - Frontend (Website): <link>
  - Backend (Server): <link>

2. About  
- Simple, non-technical explanation of what the app does
- Use an easy analogy (e.g., digital notebook or checklist)

3. How It Works  
- Explain using a restaurant-style analogy:
  User → Frontend → Backend → Database
- Mention React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB naturally

4. Technical Architecture  
- Explain separation of concerns
- Frontend:
  - Vite, React, Vanilla CSS
  - Show folder structure
  - Include a small CSS example (glass/frosted UI)
- Backend:
  - Express, Mongoose, MongoDB
  - Explain Models, Controllers, Routes
  - Include small code snippets
  - Show folder structure

5. Deployment  
- Frontend on Vercel
- Backend on Render
- Brief explanation of why

6. Local Setup  
- Prerequisite: Node.js
- Steps to run backend
- Steps to run frontend
- Show commands and expected behavior

Formatting rules:
- Use markdown headings
- Use emojis only in section titles
- Beginner-friendly, clean, professional tone

Output only the README content.
